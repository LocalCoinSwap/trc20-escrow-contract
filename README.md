# trc20-escrow-contract

Escrow smart contract to allow trading TRC20 tokens like USDT, USDC, on TRON network, in a non-custodial fashion.

## What it does?

It allows a seller to safely place their tokens into Escrow and give them ability to release it to the buyer. The contract can also handle cancellation and disputes on chain.

## Production

The smart contract is deployed to mainnet here: https://tronscan.org/#/contract/TADZM9U2uBM9j9tsPHESBqRi8MmLsj9MQS/code

Verification pending because I'm facing 504 when trying to upload source code on tronscan.

## Testing

The python test scripts are placed in a separate repo which will be added here soon to test on shasta testnet and also on mainnet.
